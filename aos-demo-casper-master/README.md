## Anthropos branded demo screens
This demo contains static html files and is styled generically.

## How to use the demo
- Unzip the `branded-demo.tar.gz` file
- Go into the `clients` folder
- Open up `index.html`
- You will now see the Demo Home screen in your web browser
- Begin using the demo

## Create local tar file for project
From the command line ( ~/repository/aos-demo-casper ), you can run `npm run build` to run the build task in `package.json`. This will create a tar called `anthropos-branded-demo.tar.gz`

## Jenkins integration
This builds the tar file and stores as an artifact which can be downloaded.
